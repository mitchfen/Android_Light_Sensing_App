# Mitch's Light Sensor <img src="https://github.com/mitchfen/light_sensing_app/blob/main/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/lightbulb.png" width = 40 height = 40>


### Overview
Basic app that reads light sensor on a timer.  
It also writes sensor data to a text file.  

Developed on a OnePlus3 running Lineage OS 17.1 (Android SDK Platform 29 ~ Android 10)
  
### Installation
You will need to use Android Studio to install SDK 29 before you can build the app. Or you can download the apk from the releases page.

Note that I used a linear layout and 5.5" screen for my tests, so it may look strange on different sized devices.
