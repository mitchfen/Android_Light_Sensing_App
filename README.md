# Mitch's Light Sensor

### Overview
Basic app that reads light sensor on a timer.  
It also writes sensor data to a txt file.
Aren't light units fascinating?  
  
### Installation
Clone this repository and open, and build in Android Studio.  
Note that I used a linear layout and 5.5" screen for my tests, so it may look wrong on different sized devices.
